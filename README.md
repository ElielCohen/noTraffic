# Polygon Homework

Here is both the backend and the frontend regarding the Polygon homework, you will find the following :

Backend 
- Written in Python, with Pydantic 2.0, FastAPI and TinyDB for persistence
- Complete CRUD, meaning I've added as well UPDATE of a specific polygon and GET of a specific polygon to the API
- Sleep 5 seconds on any write operations with queue/lock mechanism to allow other requests to be handled after
- Dockerization of the API
- Unit tests

Frontend
- Written in React JSX
- Handle Edit of existing polygon (little surprise, thought it would be fun to do), allow you to intuitively and visually resize, move and add edges to an existing polygon.
- Added a polished design (for a homework :)
- UI tests

Hope you like it :)
